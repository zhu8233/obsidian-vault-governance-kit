# Vault Canonical Promotion

## Overview

This skill exists to stop agents from publishing working notes as official knowledge too early. It routes durable material through a promotion process instead of silent direct edits.

## Promotion Conditions

The candidate should have:

- a resolved `topic_id`
- valid source lineage
- curation-level stability
- long-term reuse value
- a clear home in canonical knowledge

Read `references/promotion-criteria.md` before promoting.

## Standard Flow

1. Confirm the source note lives in `intake` or `curation`
2. Check whether canonical already exists for the topic
3. If canonical exists and you are not Hermes/human, prepare a proposal instead of overwriting
4. Add or update `promotion-queue.json`
5. Add ledger entry
6. Leave final merge to Hermes or a human

## Allowed Actions

- create promotion candidate
- update queue item
- prepare proposal note
- recommend canonical target path

## Disallowed Actions

- silent overwrite of canonical notes
- reclassifying raw notes as canonical without curation
- skipping queue update

## Common Mistakes

- treating polished wording as proof of canonical readiness
- publishing without checking for existing canonical home
- forgetting to record why this note deserves promotion
