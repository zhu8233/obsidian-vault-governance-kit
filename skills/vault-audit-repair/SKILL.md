# Vault Audit And Repair

## Overview

This skill checks whether the vault still matches its own governance model. It is for diagnosis first and repair second.

## Audit Targets

- missing or stale topic mapping
- orphan files
- duplicate topics
- notes without required metadata
- canonical notes updated outside the expected process
- registry and filesystem mismatch

## Audit Order

1. Read `RULES.md`
2. Read all registry files
3. Compare topic paths to real files
4. Inspect canonical drift
5. Inspect promotion queue backlog
6. Decide whether the fix is:
   - metadata-only
   - registry-only
   - proposal-based
   - coordinator-required

Read `references/audit-checklist.md` for the full checklist.

## Repair Rule

Prefer the smallest safe repair:

- fix registry before moving content
- fix topic identity before renaming folders
- use proposals when canonical content is involved

## Common Mistakes

- deleting files just because registry forgot them
- treating every mismatch as a content problem
- repairing canonical drift without recording it
