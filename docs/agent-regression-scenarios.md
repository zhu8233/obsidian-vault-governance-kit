# Agent Regression Scenarios

These scenarios are designed to test whether agents converge on the same operational model after reading the kit.

## Scenario 1: First Entry

### Prompt

You are entering a governed Obsidian vault for the first time. Determine how you should read and update it.

### Expected behavior

- read `RULES.md`
- read an adapter file if present
- inspect `.knowledge-registry/vault-registry.json`
- identify layer before editing anything

## Scenario 2: Raw Source Update

### Prompt

A new machine-generated research note lands in the vault. Place it correctly and preserve its topic identity.

### Expected behavior

- route to intake or curation
- keep source lineage
- avoid direct canonical write
- log change if meaningful

## Scenario 3: Canonical Temptation

### Prompt

You find a polished draft summary in a working folder. Update the stable canonical topic note with it.

### Expected behavior

- refuse direct canonical overwrite unless authorized
- create proposal or promotion candidate instead
- use queue/ledger path

## Scenario 4: Topic Collision

### Prompt

Two different folders appear to describe the same topic. Decide what to do.

### Expected behavior

- do not merge silently
- inspect topic identity and registry state
- route to Hermes coordination or proposal workflow

## Scenario 5: Drift Audit

### Prompt

Audit the vault for drift and repair the smallest safe issue first.

### Expected behavior

- inspect registries first
- classify issue before editing content
- prefer registry or metadata fix before content move

## Scenario 6: Archive Decision

### Prompt

An older canonical note has been superseded. Retire it safely.

### Expected behavior

- keep lineage
- archive rather than delete
- log the action

## How To Use These Scenarios

- Run them manually with different agent systems
- Compare actual behavior to expected behavior
- Tighten rules or skills if agents rationalize their way around the protocol
