# Obsidian Vault Governance Kit

Portable governance kit for multi-agent Obsidian vault maintenance.

This project is for people who want a personal or team knowledge vault that can be edited by:

- humans
- ingestion workflows
- specialist agents
- coordinator agents
- multiple model ecosystems

without losing topic identity, source lineage, canonical stability, or long-term maintainability.

## Why This Exists

Most vaults break under multi-agent maintenance for the same reasons:

- every agent reads different entry files
- raw intake and durable knowledge get mixed together
- topic identity is implicit in folder names instead of explicit in registry state
- updates happen without a shared change log
- "final" notes are overwritten by working notes

This kit solves that by combining:

1. one human rule source: `RULES.md`
2. compatibility entry files: `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`
3. one machine fact layer: `.knowledge-registry/`
4. a portable skill pack for agent behavior
5. promotion and audit workflows to control drift

## Design

### Core model

The governance model has five layers:

| Layer | Purpose | Typical examples |
|------|---------|------------------|
| `system` | rules, schemas, registries, workflow docs | `RULES.md`, `.knowledge-registry/` |
| `intake` | raw or machine-landed material | imports, source dumps, NotebookLM outputs |
| `curation` | reorganized working knowledge | topic indexes, draft syntheses, cleaned notes |
| `canonical` | durable, high-findability knowledge | stable summaries, durable topic indexes |
| `archive` | frozen or retired material | superseded canonical notes, retired topics |

### Rule source strategy

`RULES.md` is the single rule source.

`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `GEMINI.md` are thin adapters that point back to `RULES.md`.

That lets the same vault work across multiple agent ecosystems without making the governance model vendor-specific.

### Registry strategy

`.knowledge-registry/` stores machine-readable facts:

- `vault-registry.json`
- `agent-roster.json`
- `promotion-queue.json`
- `change-ledger.jsonl`

The registry is the source of truth for:

- topic IDs
- object identity
- layer placement
- agent roles
- promotion state
- change history

### Agent behavior strategy

The skill pack teaches agents how to:

- enter a governed vault
- identify layer and topic
- decide if they can write
- route work into intake, curation, promotion, audit, or Hermes coordination

## Included Components

### Skill pack

- `vault-governance`
- `vault-intake-curation`
- `vault-canonical-promotion`
- `vault-audit-repair`
- `hermes-coordination`

### Schema pack

- `schemas/vault-registry.schema.json`
- `schemas/agent-roster.schema.json`
- `schemas/promotion-queue.schema.json`
- `schemas/change-ledger-entry.schema.json`

### Vault bootstrap templates

- `templates/vault-root/RULES.md`
- `templates/vault-root/CLAUDE.md`
- `templates/vault-root/AGENTS.md`
- `templates/vault-root/GEMINI.md`
- `templates/vault-root/.knowledge-registry/*`

### Example governed vault

- `examples/portable-vault/`

## Quickstart

### 1. Copy templates into your vault root

Copy everything under `templates/vault-root/` into the root of the target vault.

At minimum you want:

- `RULES.md`
- one or more adapter files
- `.knowledge-registry/`

### 2. Adjust the templates

Edit:

- `RULES.md`
- `.knowledge-registry/agent-roster.json`
- `.knowledge-registry/vault-registry.json`

Customize:

- agent IDs
- local topic naming rules
- local folder conventions
- any platform-specific adapter wording

### 3. Register your first topics

Add 3-5 real topics to `vault-registry.json`.

Do not try to register the entire vault at once.

### 4. Install the skill pack

Copy the folders under `skills/` into your agent skill directory, or vendor them into your own agent setup.

### 5. Start with intake and curation only

Do not enable canonical promotion on day one.

First verify that:

- agents reliably read `RULES.md`
- topic IDs stay consistent
- change ledger entries are created

### 6. Enable canonical promotion

Once the team is comfortable:

- turn on the promotion queue workflow
- give Hermes or a human the coordinator role

## Agent Onboarding

The intended onboarding path for any agent is:

1. read `RULES.md`
2. read the nearest adapter file if present
3. read `.knowledge-registry/vault-registry.json`
4. determine target `topic_id`
5. determine target layer
6. check write authority in `agent-roster.json`
7. route to the appropriate skill

If you want "any agent can enter and align quickly", this onboarding path is the minimum contract.

## Validation

This repository includes a self-contained validator:

```bash
python scripts/validate_repo.py
```

It checks:

- required repo files exist
- skill metadata is present
- no `TODO` placeholders remain in `SKILL.md`
- `openai.yaml` prompts mention the correct `$skill-name`
- JSON and JSONL files parse
- template and example vault registry files parse

GitHub Actions also runs this validation on push and pull request.

## Publishing

This repository is designed to be published on GitHub.

Recommended release steps:

1. run `python scripts/validate_repo.py`
2. review `README.md`
3. review `templates/vault-root/`
4. review `examples/portable-vault/`
5. commit and push

## Limitations

This kit improves convergence, but does not create absolute enforcement by itself.

Skills guide behavior.
Registries carry facts.
Audit catches drift.

If an agent refuses to read the rules, no documentation package can fully save it. This is why the model uses both adapter files and registry-backed audits.

## Current Status

This is a publishable v1:

- architecture defined
- templates included
- example vault included
- skill pack included
- validation script included
- GitHub workflow included

The main recommended next step after publishing is real multi-agent regression testing against live vault tasks.
